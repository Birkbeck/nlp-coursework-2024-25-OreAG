Answers to the text questions go here:


When is the Flesch Kincaid score *not* a valid, robust or reliable estimator of 4
text difficulty? Give two conditions. (Text answer, 200 words maximum).

Although, widely used, the Flesch-Kincaid score doesn't always reflect the difficulty of a text. For instance,
some texts might use relatively simple sentence structures but still contain technical or highly specialised vocabulary.

  This means that a medical or legal document can get an 'easy score' according to the formula if the sentences are
short and the words meet the syllable count criteria. However a non-medical professional is likely to struggle to
understand it (Benjamin , 2012)

Another issue is how the formula handles text that don't follow the standard grammar or syntax. These include literary
texts (older versions) or works that creatively play around with sentence boundaries or structure. Scenarios like
these are likely to confuse the algorithm. This can make it overestimate or underestimate how difficult the text really
is to read( Collins-Thompson, 2014)

In both cases, the formula seems to miss what actually makes a text complex (e.g. context or familiarity with the subject matter)
These are often the real barriers to comprehension which the Flesch-Kincaid method doesn't account for(Dubay, 2004)
